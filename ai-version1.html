        <p>Liv stood at the edge of the sprawling campus courtyard, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the polished brick paths. Her suitcase felt heavier than it was, nerves pulling her in different directions.</p>
        <p>She paused, gazing up at the stone archways that framed the entrance to her dormitory. The prestigious Elmore University, known globally for producing the next generation of leaders and elites, loomed before her. A soft breeze rustled the ivy climbing the walls, carrying faint laughter from distant students.</p>

                    <p>Liv pulled open the heavy oak door and stepped into the dorm lobby. The scent of fresh paint and coffee lingered in the air. She spotted a girl by the window, scrolling through her phone, effortlessly glamorous in an oversized sweater and designer boots.</p>
                    <p>The girl glanced up, brightening instantly. "Hey! You must be my new roommate. I'm Chloe."</p>
                    <p>Liv hesitated, taking in Chloe’s flawless makeup and confident smile.</p>

                    <p>The warmth in Chloe’s voice eased some of Liv’s nerves.</p>
                    <p>The day slipped into evening as the two unpacked, trading stories about their hometowns and favorite books. Chloe’s effortless confidence balanced Liv’s quiet excitement. For the first time, Elmore felt less intimidating.</p>

                    <p>"We’re going to a party tonight. Rooftop, VIP crowd. It’s the best way to meet everyone who matters." Chloe glanced at Liv through the mirror’s reflection. "You’re coming, right?"</p>
